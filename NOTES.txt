"classname" = React's version of class
"styles" is the object that we are importing from the css file
".section" grabs the class from the css file

so if i put styles.section it takes from .section in my css file.
if i put styles.subtitle it takes from .subtitle in my css file.

its using "styles" and not "page.modules" bc i used import styles
whatever the name is after import i have to use that name to pull from that file

<section> is the tag we use to group elements together.
used mostly for grouping things together
